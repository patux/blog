### Health
Last saturday got my second b12 shot, and had long week in MX due [Revolution Day (México)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Day_(Mexico)) which I used to take some rest and recover. I am feeling better than last week. I can't wait to go back to biking again.

### Family
Spend long weekend with family, and yesterday I was able to take my dog out :-)

### Blogging

I start to understand [Hugo Framework](https://gohugo.io/) a little bit more. Added [Simple Shortcode to Insert Raw HTML in Hugo](https://anaulin.org/blog/hugo-raw-html-shortcode/), I wanted to start adding some pics to post and I dont want to open my instagram account, so I started to use my old [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) there I can select which picture to share.
