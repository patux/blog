Good summary from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) on [How Bezos Phone Was Hacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/jeff-bezos-hack-iphone.html), the article clearly states that the phone used by Bezos was an iphone X.

The end statement of the article is so true :pensive:

>“It basically means that we are all extremely vulnerable” - Agnes Callamard
