### life/health

I’ve been sick for 3 weeks :-( started with cold and throat  infection… then it got worse with my long life ilness and nightmare: “gastritis”. Then I went to the gastro and he sent me to the hematologist, cause  I have annemia :-( 

5 months ago, due the pain and problems with my digestive system I went back to a healthy way of living, diet, excersise (mountain biking, swiming), and sleep well… and in fact [I was doing great](https://www.strava.com/athletes/23567620) or that is what I thought… Oh well :-( I have to take care of my health more closely.

### blogging 

I'll try to retake blogging as a occupational theraphy... Let's see if that works.
