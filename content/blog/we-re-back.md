After almost a year out, I am bringing my personal site and blog back to life. 

Lots and lots of blog post and personal history and growth trough my journey in the open source and software technology are lost... 
Anyway, we must move on...

This is the first of my post to held random toughts, some of them about technology, sometimes just to held list of likns that I thought are interested to go back and review sometime in the future, sometimes social events related to technology (like meetups, conferences, etc). And last but not least personal thoughts, rants or experiences about my journey of being a Software Engineering Manager in the Open Source World... 

Let 2018 begin...
